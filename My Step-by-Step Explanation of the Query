SELECT Clause:
SELECT stay, COUNT(inter_dom) AS count_int, ROUND(AVG(todep),2) AS average_phq, ROUND(AVG(tosc),2) AS average_scs, ROUND(AVG(toas),2) AS average_as

stay: Represents the length of stay of the students, which is the primary factor being analyzed.
COUNT(inter_dom) AS count_int: Calculates the number of international students for each length of stay and aliases it as count_int.
ROUND(AVG(todep), 2) AS average_phq: Computes the average PHQ-9 test scores for each length of stay, rounded to two decimal places, and aliases it as average_phq.
ROUND(AVG(tosc), 2) AS average_scs: Computes the average SCS test scores for each length of stay, rounded to two decimal places, and aliases it as average_scs.
ROUND(AVG(toas), 2) AS average_as: Computes the average ASISS test scores for each length of stay, rounded to two decimal places, and aliases it as average_as.

FROM Clause:
FROM students

Specifies the students table as the source of the data.

WHERE Clause:
WHERE inter_dom = 'Inter'

Filters the records to include only international students. The condition inter_dom = 'Inter' ensures that only rows where the inter_dom column has the value 'Inter' are considered.

GROUP BY Clause:
GROUP BY stay

Groups the records by the stay column. This means that all the records with the same length of stay will be aggregated together.

ORDER BY Clause:
ORDER BY stay DESC

Orders the results by the stay column in descending order. This means that records with the longest stay will appear first.

LIMIT Clause:
LIMIT 9;

Limits the number of rows returned by the query to 9. This ensures that the output table has only nine rows.
