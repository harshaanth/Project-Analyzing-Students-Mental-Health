FROM: Identifies the source table (students).
WHERE: Filters rows to include only international students.
GROUP BY: Groups the filtered rows by stay.
SELECT: Selects and calculates the specified columns.
ORDER BY: Sorts the results by stay in descending order.
LIMIT: Limits the result set to 9 rows.
This logical sequence ensures that the data is filtered, grouped, aggregated, sorted, and then limited to produce the final result set.
